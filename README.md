Easy migrate is a small Node.JS package for database migrations. It is based on Laravel migrations concept and it uses similar structure and design.
Usage of the package is ultimatly the same except for some functions that are not implemented in easy-migrate like hasColumn, hasTable.

Currently it is only developed for PostgreSQL but driver and builders can be implemented for other databases.
